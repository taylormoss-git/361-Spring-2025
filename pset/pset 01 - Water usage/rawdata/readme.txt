All documents contain final Irrigation Water Use (IWU) estimates detailed in the associated publication. These results are obtained by calculating crop allocations using PCR-GLOBWB 2.0 with CONUS-specific data inputs (i.e. PCR-CONUS), and applying these allocations to USGS water use data. 

All csv files in this folder specify the type of water: where GWA is Groundwater Abstractions, GWD is Groundwater Depletion, and SW is Surface water Withdrawals; followed by the year, ranging from 2008 to 2020. 

Within each file, the columns represent US County identifiers ("GEOID" or County FIPS codes), followed by the water source in question (i.e. gwa, gwd, or sww) accompanied by a specific crop (i.e. corn, cotton, millet, etc. There are three "other" categories listed as "other_sctg2", "other_sctg3", and "other_sctg4". These correspond to the other categories as follows... 

Other SCTG 2 = Other Grains
Other SCTG 3 = Other Produce
Other SCTG 4 = Other Animal Feed
